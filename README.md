# Twitter-Mapper
Java program that allows user to search and filter through Twitter, mapping the tweets based on location.

Currently using a playback version of Twitter, but could be altered to use live Twitter feed by signing up as Twitter developer, and entering keys and access tokens.

Load dependencies (jar files) as modules in Intellij before running application. 

Part of University of British Columbia Software Development program.
